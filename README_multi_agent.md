# 🚗🚗 CARLA Lane Keeping — Multi-Agent PPO

> **MSc Thesis Project** | Multi-agent extension of a PPO-based lane-keeping system, training multiple independent vehicles simultaneously inside the CARLA simulator.

---

## 📌 Overview

This project extends the [single-agent lane-keeping system](https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/carla-lane-keeping-ppo-single-agent) to a **multi-agent setting**, where multiple vehicles are trained in parallel within the same CARLA world. Each agent operates independently (no inter-agent coordination), sharing the environment but learning from its own experience stream — effectively providing richer and more diverse training data to the PPO policy.

The work is part of an MSc thesis exploring deep reinforcement learning for autonomous vehicle control.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Multiple independent agents** running in the same CARLA world simultaneously
- **Custom `VecEnv` wrapper** (`MultiAgentCarlaWrapper`) compatible with Stable-Baselines3
- **Ghost mode**: agents do not collide with each other (physically independent)
- All single-agent features are preserved:
  - Stacked-frame visual observations (4 × 128×128 RGB)
  - Continuous action space: steering, throttle, brake
  - Shaped reward function with collision, lane departure, and smoothness terms
  - PPO with linear LR schedule and entropy annealing
  - TensorBoard logging and model checkpointing

## ⚙️ Multi-Agent Architecture

The `MultiAgentCarlaWrapper` inherits from Stable-Baselines3's `VecEnv`, making it a drop-in replacement for vectorized environments. Each agent is a full `CarlaLaneKeepingEnv` instance with its own vehicle spawned in the CARLA world.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Windows 10/11 (CARLA runs natively on Windows)
- Python 3.7
- CARLA 0.9.15
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended — multiple agents are GPU-intensive)
- Sufficient RAM (≥ 16 GB recommended for 2+ agents)

### Python Dependencies

```bash
pip install stable-baselines3[extra]
pip install gymnasium
pip install numpy
pip install tensorboard
```

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Install CARLA

Download [CARLA 0.9.15](https://github.com/carla-simulator/carla/releases/tag/0.9.15) and extract it.

### 2. Configure Paths and Agent Count

Open `lane_keeping_parameters.py` and update:

```python
# Paths
BASE_PATH = "your\\path\\to\\project"
CARLA_EGG_PATH = "your\\path\\to\\carla-0.9.15-py3.7-win-amd64.egg"

# Multi-agent settings
class MultiAgentParams:
    ENABLE_MULTI_AGENT = True
    NUM_AGENTS = 2          # Increase if your hardware supports it
```

### 3. Launch CARLA Server

```bash
cd "C:\path\to\CARLA_0.9.15\WindowsNoEditor"
CarlaUE4.exe -quality-level=Low -benchmark -fps=20
```

> ⚠️ **Important:** Use `-quality-level=Low` when running multiple agents to reduce GPU load.

### 4. Run Training

```bash
python training_lane_keeping_ppo.py
```

The wrapper will automatically spawn all agents with a 2-second delay between each to avoid CARLA spawn conflicts.

### 5. Monitor Training (Optional)

```bash
tensorboard --logdir ./logs
```

## 📊 Training Notes

- Each agent auto-resets independently when its episode ends
- Failed agent steps are handled gracefully with dummy observations — training continues uninterrupted
- Models are saved every **10,000 timesteps**
- Evaluation runs every **5,000 timesteps** over 5 episodes
- To add more agents, increase `MultiAgentParams.NUM_AGENTS` — but monitor your VRAM and RAM usage

## ⚡ Single-Agent vs Multi-Agent Comparison

| Feature | Single Agent | Multi Agent |
|---------|-------------|-------------|
| Vehicles in world | 1 | 2+ |
| Experience diversity | Lower | Higher |
| Training speed | Baseline | Faster (parallel data) |
| Hardware requirement | Moderate | Higher |
| VecEnv compatible | No | Yes |
